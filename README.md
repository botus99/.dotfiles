# .dotfiles

｡*ﾟ.*.｡(っ ᐛ )っ HELLO!!!

Behold, my dotfiles! They are meticulously assembled to make Debian Testing truly cromulent! 🎉🥂

I hope these dotfiles serve as a source of inspiration for your own unique setup 🦄.

I am currently using Cinnamon with X11 (thanks Nvidia) and have not used Sway or Wayland for some time now. I am ultimately trying to make Debian Testing more capable in a media-server and/or media-enthusiast-desktop context. How?

- ffmpeg compiled with headers for Nvidia codecs and CUDA
- avisynth / vapoursynth
- reaper daw

There may be unexpected behaviors when you set it up on your hardware. You're not going to let that stop you though, right? 🧠💫 With a little bit of tweaking, you can customize everything here to fit your own wants and needs 🏆🛠️. Brace yourself for these mediocre dotfiles! 🙌🎉✨

## To-Do List

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [x] Add more stuff that I use (tgpt, shell-color-scripts, plymouth, ly...) 📦🔥😎
- [x] Add ricing stuff (Colloid-Red-Dark-Gruvbox, ArcDusk-Cursors, Papirus-Dark) 🌈🍚🌺
- [x] Add even more stuff that I use (stylepak, gruvbox-papirus-folders nwg-look...) 🎀🎨🤩
- [x] Add deb-multimedia.org repo 💽
- [x] Add DRD Team Debian repo 💽
- [ ] Add prompts at certain points in the script 🧐
- [ ] Add configs for Flatpak applications 🧩
- [ ] Crossing the line with how many emojis a readme doc really needs 💩
