# .dotfiles

Welcome to my truly ðŸŒŸcromulentðŸŒŸ dotfiles, meticulously crafted to optimize your Debian system!

## Applications Used

Great sports teams have great players that work well together and have complimenting strengths. Linux setups are no different. Prepare to be leveled by this lineup of applications for this Debian setup:

- Sway
- Waybar
- PCManFM
- Alacritty
- Kitty
- LibreWolf
- VSCodium
- Gedit
- Evolution
- Thunderbird

Although a work in progress, I hope that they can offer inspiration for your own personalized experience. Please note that not everything currently works as I continue to ascend towards perfection, and your setup may introduce some twists and turns along the way. So, brace yourself for these barely mediocre dotfiles!

## To-Do List

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [ ] Fix Waybar configuration issue where the bar height changes sometimes                                # totally my fault, I'm sure
- [ ] Add configs for Flatpak applications
- [ ] Find a lightweight browser to supplement Librewolf

Not as important stuff that I am considering:

- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from kitty or alacritty
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from VSCodium or Gedit
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from Thunderbird or Evolution
