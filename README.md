# .dotfiles

｡*ﾟ.*.｡(っ ᐛ )っ HELLO!!!

Welcome to my dotfiles, meticulously and specifically assembled to make your Debian system truly cromulent! 🎉🥂

You may or may not love the way that I have everything set up, but, at a minimum, I hope that this dotfiles repo can serve as a source of inspiration for your own unique setup 🦄.

## Applications Used

Great sports teams have a great staff that work well together and combine their strengths to achieve a winning result. 😎🏆 Linux setups aren't much different. ⚙️🐧 Prepare to be leveled by this lineup of applications 🤸🏻 :

- Sway
- Waybar
- PCManFM
- Alacritty
- LibreWolf
- VSCodium

There may be unexpected behaviors when you set it up on your hardware. You're not going to let that stop you though, right? 🧠💫 With a little bit of tweaking, you can customize everything here to fit your own wants and needs 🏆🛠️. Brace yourself for these mediocre dotfiles! 🙌🎉✨
