# .dotfiles

｡*ﾟ.*.｡(っ ᐛ )っ HELLO!!!

Welcome to my dotfiles, meticulously assembled to make your Debian Sid system 💀 truly cromulent! 🎉🥂

You may or may not love the way that I have it, but I hope that it can serve as a source of inspiration for your own unique setup 🦄.

## Applications Used

Great sports teams have great players that work well together and have complimenting strengths. 😎🏆 Linux setups are no different. ⚙️🐧 Prepare to be leveled by this lineup of applications for this Debian setup 🤸🏻 :

- Sway
- Waybar
- PCManFM
- Alacritty
- LibreWolf
- VSCodium
- Evolution

Keep in mind that there may be unexpected behaviors when you set it up on your hardware. 🧠💫 This repository was created using an Intel Core2Duo CPU 🥔 at 1080p resolution 🖥️🐒. Its scalability to other resolutions is uncertain... 🎱 but don't let that stop you from giving it a try! 👀💪 With a little bit of tweaking, you can customize it to fit your needs 🏆🛠️. So, brace yourself for these mediocre dotfiles! 🙌🎉✨

## To-Do List

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [x] Add more stuff that I use (FirefoxPWA, shell-color-scripts, plymouth, ly...) 📦🔥😎
- [x] Add even more stuff that I use (stylepak, nwg-look...) 🎀🎨🤩
- [x] Add ricing stuff (Matcha-gtk-theme, ArcDusk-Cursors, vimix-icon-theme) 🌈🍚🌺
- [ ] Add prompts at certain points in the script 🧐
- [ ] Add configs for Flatpak applications 🧩
- [ ] Tweak swaync widgets further 🛠️
- [ ] Find a lightweight browser to supplement Librewolf 🔍
- [ ] Crossing the line with how many emojis a readme doc really needs 💩

Not as important stuff that I am considering:

- [x] 🤔 Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from Thunderbird or Evolution
- [x] 🤔 Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from VSCodium or Gedit
- [ ] 🤔 Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from kitty or alacritty
