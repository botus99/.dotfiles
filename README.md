# .dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, meticulously assembled to make your Debian Sid system truly ✨ cromulent 🎉🥂🎊

## Applications Used

Great sports teams have great players that work well together and have complimenting strengths. Linux setups are no different. Prepare to be leveled by this lineup of applications for this Debian setup:

- Sway
- Waybar
- PCManFM
- Alacritty
- LibreWolf
- VSCodium
- Evolution

Although a personal work,  I hope it can serve as a source of inspiration for your own unique setup 🦄. Keep in mind that there may be unexpected behaviors when you set it up on your hardware. This repository was created using an Intel Core2Duo 🥔 at 1080p resolution 🖥️🐒. Its scalability to other resolutions is uncertain. But don't let that stop you from giving it a try! With a little bit of tweaking, you can customize it to fit your needs 🏆🛠️. So, brace yourself for these mediocre dotfiles!

## To-Do List

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [x] Add more stuff that I use (FirefoxPWA, shell-color-scripts, plymouth, ly...)
- [ ] Add even more stuff that I use (stylepak, nwg-look...)
- [ ] Add ricing stuff (Matcha-gtk-theme, ArcDusk-Cursors, vimix-icon-theme)
- [ ] Add prompts at certain points in the script
- [ ] Add configs for Flatpak applications
- [ ] Find a lightweight browser to supplement Librewolf

Not as important stuff that I am considering:

- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from kitty or alacritty
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from VSCodium or Gedit
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from Thunderbird or Evolution
