# .dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles, meticulously assembled to make your Debian system truly âœ¨ cromulent ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥‚ðŸŽŠ

## Applications Used

Great sports teams have great players that work well together and have complimenting strengths. Linux setups are no different. Prepare to be leveled by this lineup of applications for this Debian setup:

- Sway
- Waybar
- PCManFM
- Alacritty
- LibreWolf
- VSCodium
- Evolution

Although a potentially endless work in progress, I hope that they can offer inspiration for your own personalized experience. Please note that not everything currently works as intended on my setup yet, and your setup may introduce some unexpexted behavior. So, brace yourself for these mediocre dotfiles!

## To-Do List

Here's what I'm currently working on:

- [x] Add more stuff that I use (FirefoxPWA, shell-color-scripts, plymouth, ly...)
- [ ] Add even more stuff that I use (stylepak, nwg-look...)
- [ ] Add ricing stuff (Matcha-gtk-theme, ArcDusk-Cursors, vimix-icon-theme)
- [ ] Add prompts at certain points in the script
- [ ] Add configs for Flatpak applications
- [ ] Find a lightweight browser to supplement Librewolf

Not as important stuff that I am considering:

- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from kitty or alacritty
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from VSCodium or Gedit
- [ ] Figure out if I want to stick with / switch away from Thunderbird or Evolution
